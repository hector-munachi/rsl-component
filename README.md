# rsl-component 

A reusable React component that simplifies the process of adding Region, State, and LGA selection drop-downs to forms in web applications. This helps developers by eliminating the need to build these inputs from scratch. 

ðŸ”— **[Demo](https://rsl-component.netlify.app/)**

## Installation

Install this package with npm or yarn:

```bash
# If you use npm:
npm install rsl-component

# Or if you use Yarn:
yarn add rsl-component
```
    
## Usage

Import and use the InputRSL component in your React component.
```javascript
import InputRSL from 'rsl-component';

<InputRSL />
```

## Example
When you use the `InputRSL` component in your form, you can pass down the `selectedRegion`, `selectedState`, and `selectedLga` values as props, and also pass down the corresponding `handleRegionChange`, `handleStateChange`, and `handleLgaChange` callback functions to update the state when the user makes selections.

Here's an example of how you can use the `InputRSL` component in a form:

```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import InputRSL from 'rsl-component'; // Import the InputRSL component

const MyForm = () => {
  const [formData, setFormData] = useState({
    region: '',
    state: '',
    lga: '',
  });

  const handleFormSubmit = (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    // Access the selected values from the form data state
    const { region, state, lga } = formData;
    // Perform form submission with the selected values
    // ... Your form submission logic here ...
  };

  const handleRegionChange = (region) => {
    setFormData(prevFormData => ({ ...prevFormData, region }));
  };

  const handleStateChange = (state) => {
    setFormData(prevFormData => ({ ...prevFormData, state }));
  };

  const handleLgaChange = (lga) => {
    setFormData(prevFormData => ({ ...prevFormData, lga }));
  };

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleFormSubmit}>
      {/* Render the InputRSL component with props and callbacks */}
      <InputRSL
        selectedRegion={formData.region}
        selectedState={formData.state}
        selectedLga={formData.lga}
        handleRegionChange={handleRegionChange}
        handleStateChange={handleStateChange}
        handleLgaChange={handleLgaChange}
      />
      {/* ...Other form inputs and submit button... */}
    </form>
  );
};

export default MyForm;

```

In this example, the `formData` state holds the values selected by the user in the `InputRSL` component, and the corresponding `handleRegionChange`, `handleStateChange`, and `handleLgaChange` callback functions are passed as props to the `InputRSL` component to update the form data state when the user makes selections. You can then access the selected values from the form data state (`formData.region`, `formData.state`, and `formData.lga`) and use them for your form submission logic.

## `showRegion` prop
The `showRegion` prop is a boolean that controls the visibility of the "Region" input field in the InputRSL component. If set to `true`, the "Region" input field will be displayed, and if set to `false`, the "Region" input field will be hidden.

**To use the** `showRegion` prop, simply pass it to the `InputRSL` component as a boolean prop. For example:
```javascript
<InputRSL showRegion={true} />

```
In this example, we're passing the `showRegion` prop with a value of `true`, which means that the "Region" input field will be displayed in the `InputRSL` component.

To hide the "Region" input field, simply set the showRegion prop to `false`:
```javascript
<InputRSL showRegion={false} />

```
In this example, we're passing the showRegion prop with a value of `false`, which means that the "Region" input field will be hidden in the `InputRSL` component.

**By default value**, the `showRegion` prop is set to `true`, which means that the "Region" input field will be displayed in the `InputRSL` component if the prop is not explicitly set to `false`.

**Take note that** if you set `showRegion` to `false`, the first input field will be hidden, and the remaining two input fields will shift up to take its place. If you set `showRegion` to `true`, the "Region" input field will be displayed, and the remaining two input fields will shift down to make space for it.
